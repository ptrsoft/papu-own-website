      <p>I am helping businesses build efficient, scalable, and resilient cloud-native applications. I specialize in implementing modern infrastructure solutions like Docker, Kubernetes, and serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) to reduce complexity, improve resource efficiency, and accelerate deployment times.</p>
      <h4  className="d-block w-100 pb-3 mb-3">With my services, I help you:
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Containerize applications for greater portability and consistency across environments.
    </li>
    <li>Implement Kubernetes orchestration for seamless scaling, automation, and management of containerized workloads.
    </li>
    <li>Optimize serverless architectures to reduce infrastructure management and achieve cost-efficient, scalable applications.
    </li>
    <li>Build CI/CD pipelines that integrate with your containerized or serverless environments for rapid, reliable deployment.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
Whether you're starting from scratch or modernizing existing infrastructure, I ensure your applications run smoothly with minimal overhead, enabling your team to focus on innovation rather than operations.
